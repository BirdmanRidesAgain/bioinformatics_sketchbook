This repository contains formatted versions of my previous notes files
It is meant to organize and synthesize them into a more easily-accessable format, so I can find syntax when I need it
  Code stored comes primarily from "Stone_curlew_notes", "Houbara_mtDNA", "vcf-filtering+analysis" and "ONT_data_draft_genomes"
